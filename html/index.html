        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" />PyKeylogger</h2>
          <p>
            PyKeylogger is a simple keylogger written in the python programming language.
            I threw it together one day after not being able to find a simple and trustworthy
            (as in, source available) keylogger for windows. It is primarily designed for personal
            backup purposes, rather than stealth keylogging. Thus, it does not make explicit attempts
            to hide its presence from the operating system or the user. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to create a universal backup solution for everything you type. We have all
            at one time or another accidentally closed that word or notepad file without saving. We have
            all lost form data on the web after it failed to submit properly. Not even mentioning the
            everpresent threat of computer crash. PyKeylogger logs everything you 
            type, so you can recover your text of anything you type in any application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since PyKeylogger is available as a simple python source file (well, two source files now), there are no trust issues
            with using it - you can just look at the source yourself and make sure that it does exactly
            what you need it to, and nothing more. (Especially not sending your info to someone else.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think you can trust me, and/or if you are not interested in getting all those packages
            to run the source file, there is also a binary distribution available for windows.
          </p>
        <a name="download"></a>
        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" />Download</h2>
          <p>
            You can download PyKeylogger from <a
            href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=147501">the
            SourceForge download page</a>. 
          </p>

        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" />Instructions</h2>

            <p>
                How pykeylogger works is pretty evident if you just look at the source. Although as it evolves, 
                it is starting to become a little less evident.
                Here is a brief manual for people who like to know what the program is supposed to do without looking at the source. :)
            </p>
            <h4>Installing pykeylogger</h4>
            <p>
                pykeylogger requires the following dependencies:
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="http://python.org/">python</a> (only 2.3 and up, due to my using the optparse module)
                    <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncassist">pyHook</a>
                    <li> <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html">win32all extensions</a>
                    <li> <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/">py2exe</a> [<font color="red">Optional: only if you want to freeze your own executable out of source.</font> (0.5.4 and up, if you want to freeze from .pyw file, not .py)] 
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                After all those are installed, just double click the keylogger.pyw file,
                and it will run in the background, logging your keys. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can just get the binary package for windows. Unzip the archive, put the contents
                anywhere you want (as long as they are all together in the same directory, of course), and run
                keylogger.exe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Default log location is the directory "C:\Temp\logdir". If you don't like this, or any other defaults, see below
                for command line options. But in general I try to keep the defaults pretty sane, so you can just run without any options if you want to.
            </p>
            <h4>Running pykeylogger</h4>
            <p>
                Since the file's extension is ".pyw", it runs without a console window in the background,
                if you just double-click the file. If you want to see the console (to see error output, e.g.),
                just rename the file with ".py" extension, or run it from command line with 
                <pre class="code">python keylogger.pyw</pre> 
            </p>

            <h4>Controlling pykeylogger:</h4>
            <p>
                PyKeylogger accepts several commandline options to customize its behavior. They are as follows:
            </p>
            <pre>
            usage: keylogger.pyw [options]
            
            options:
              --version             show program's version number and exit
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -f DIRNAME, --file=DIRNAME
                                    write log data to DIRNAME [default: C:\Temp\logdir]
              -k, --keyboard        log keyboard input [default: True]
              -a, --addlinefeed     add linefeed [\n] character when carriage return [\r]
                                    character is detected (for Notepad compatibility)
                                    [default: False]
              -b, --parsebackspace  translate backspace chacarter into printable string
                                    [default: False]
              -e, --parseescape     translate escape chacarter into printable string
                                    [default: False]
              -x EXITKEY, --exitkey=EXITKEY
                                    specify the key to press to exit keylogger [default:
                                    F12]
              -l FLUSHKEY, --flushkey=FLUSHKEY
                                    specify the key to press to flush write buffer to file
                                    [default: F11]
              -d, --debug           debug mode (print output to console instead of the log
                                    file) [default: False]
            </pre>
            <p>
                To run in debug mode from source, make sure to use the commandline <pre class="code">python keylogger.pyw -d</pre> 
                rather than just "keylogger.pyw -d". Since the .pyw extension on the source hides the console window,
                unless you do that you will not see any output on the console, because the console is hidden. :)
                The same applies if you want to see the help output from the '-h' option.
            </p>
            <p>
                To run in debug mode from exe, use the keylogger_debug.exe with -d option, NOT the regular keylogger.exe.
            </p>
            <h4>Reading the log files</h4>
            <p>
                The log files are organized in directories, where each directory is named after the application name whose window you 
                were typing into. Inside those directories, there are multiple text files, each file named by date, unique window handle,
                and window title. Thus, if you want to find what you typed in notepad, first go to the notepad directory, then find the 
                log file by date and window title.
            <p>
                The log file has two non-printable characters in it: backspace, and escape. Thus, opening the file with
                Notepad or Wordpad, you will see a lot of "junk", if you press a lot of backspace (which I do).
                To read the file properly (where backspace and escape are marked as such), use the excellent editor
                called <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to use windows notepad or wordpad, you may want to clean up the log file, by modifying the filter
                in pykeylogger to substitute a string for those characters, as well as putting in \n\r instead of just \n 
                in order to get the linebreaks in notepad to show up. This can be accomplished by adding appropriate command
                line arguments to the keylogger (see list above).
            </p>
            <p>
                Before checking your log file, press 'F11' on the keyboard, to flush the write buffer to the file, if you want to look
                at the most recent input. If you use Wordpad, you will notice that Wordpad refuses to open a file that is being used, 
                so you will have to make a copy of the logfile and open the copy with wordpad, rather than open the logfile directly.
            </p>

        <a name="future"></a>
        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" /> Future direction [Features planned]</h2>
          <p>
            <strike>Currently, the log file just has everything dumped into it as keyboard input is received.
            This means that when you type something in say, notepad, then alt-tab into word, then write an email,
            then come back to notepad, the log file has all that input mixed in, so while it is not lost, it is hard
            to retrieve in "original condition". </strike>
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan to enhance the logging capability so that it splits the keyboard input by window, and then create 
            a log viewer, where you can search by date, application name, and window title. So that you can, for example,
            say "show me what I typed in all notepad windows yesterday", or "show me what I typed in word document titled 'some stuff'".
          </p>
          <p>
            Another feature I plan for the log viewer is to have an option to parse the backspaces and arrow keys to recreate 
            the final output, rather than have a bunch of [Backspace] and [LeftArrow] text in the log. Of course, if you want that
            to be particularly useful, you have to try to refrain from using the mouse to reposition your cursor :).
          <p>
            Of the above ideas, the enhanced log capability has already been implemented. Progress! :)
            Any other ideas, or contributions to the code, are highly welcomed.
          </p>

            If you're a programmer, please feel free to hack around in PyKeylogger code,
            to add features, or anything else you would like. Get the latest src package, or just pull 
            the latest release (or, if you are feeling daring, HEAD) from CVS.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, it would be nice if you could port the code to linux. Currently, PyKeylogger uses the pyHook
            module, which is windows only, since it is a wrapper of the set of Windows APIs. I have no access to a linux box
            at the moment, nor do I have much of a clue on how to hook keyboard input at the system level in linux.
          </p>
