        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" />PyKeylogger</h2>
          <p>
            PyKeylogger is a simple keylogger written in the python programming language.
            I threw it together one day after not being able to find a simple and trustworthy
            (as in, source available) keylogger for windows. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Since PyKeylogger is available as a simple python source file, there are no trust issues
            with using it - you can just look at the source yourself and make sure that it does exactly
            what you need it to, and nothing more. (Especially not sending your info to someone else.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think you can trust me, and/or if you are not interested it getting all those packages
            to run the source file, there is also a binary distribution available for windows.

        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" />Download</h2>
          <p>
            You can download PyKeylogger from <a
            href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=147501">the
            SourceForge download page</a>.

            <p>
                How pykeylogger works is pretty evident if you just look at the source. 
                But here is a brief manual for the lazy ones among us. :)
            </p>
            <h4>Installing pykeylogger</h4>
            <p>
                pykeylogger requires the following dependencies:
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="http://python.org/">python</a>
                    <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncassist">pyHook</a>
                    <li> <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html">win32all extensions</a>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                After all those are installed, just double click the keylogger.pyw file,
                and it will run in the background, logging your keys. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can just get the binary package for windows. Unzip the archive, put the contents
                anywhere you want (as long as they are all together in the same directory, of course), and just run
                keylogger.exe.
            </p>
            <h4>Running pykeylogger</h4>
            <p>
                Since the file's extension is ".pyw", it runs without a console window in the background,
                if you just double-click the file. If you want to see the console (to see error output, e.g.),
                just rename the file with ".py" extension.
            </p>
            <p>
                The executable does not hide its console window just yet. I am working on resolving this.
            </p>
            <h4>Controlling pykeylogger:</h4>
            <p>
                PyKeylogger accepts several commandline options to customize its behavior. They are as follows:
            </p>
            <pre>
                usage: keylogger.pyw [options]

                options:
                  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
                  -f FILENAME, --file=FILENAME
                                        write log data to FILENAME
                  -k, --keyboard        log keyboard input (default)
                  -a, --addlinefeed     add linefeed [\n] character when carriage return [\r]
                                        character is detected [for Notepad compatibility]
                  -b, --parsebackspace  translate backspace chacarter into printable string
                  -e, --parseescape     translate escape chacarter into printable string
                  -x EXITKEY, --exitkey=EXITKEY
                                        specify the key to press to exit keylogger [default:
                                        F12]
                  -l FLUSHKEY, --flushkey=FLUSHKEY
                                        specify the key to press to flush write buffer to file
                                        [default: F11]
                  -d, --debug           debug mode (print output to console instead of the log
                                        file)
            </pre>
            <p>
                To run in debug mode from source, make sure to use the commandline "python keylogger.pyw -d" 
                rather than just "keylogger.pyw -d". Since the .pyw extension on the source hides the console window,
                unless you do that you will not see any output on the console, because the console is hidden. :)
                The same applies if you want to see the help output from the '-h' option.
            </p>
            <h4>Reading the log file</h4>
            <p>
                The log file has two non-printable characters in it: backspace, and escape. Thus, opening the file with
                Notepad or Wordpad, you will see a lot of "junk", if you press a lot of backspace (which I do).
                To read the file properly (where backspace and escape are marked as such), use the excellent editor
                called <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to use windows notepad or wordpad, you may want to clean up the log file, by modifying the filter
                in pykeylogger to substitute a string for those characters, as well as putting in \n\r instead of just \n 
                in order to get the linebreaks in notepad to show up. This can be accomplished by adding appropriate command
                line arguments to the keylogger (see list above).
            </p>
            <p>
                Before checking your log file, press 'F11' on the keyboard, to flush the write buffer to the file, if you want to look
                at the most recent input. If you use Wordpad, you will notice that Wordpad refuses to open a file that is being used, 
                so you will have to make a copy of the logfile and open the copy with wordpad, rather than open the logfile directly.
            </p>
