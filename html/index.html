        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" />PyKeylogger</h2>
          <p>
            PyKeylogger is a simple keylogger written in the python programming language.
            I threw it together one day after not being able to find a simple and trustworthy
            (as in, source code available) keylogger for windows. It is primarily designed for personal
            backup purposes, rather than stealth keylogging. Thus, it does not make explicit attempts
            to hide its presence from the operating system or the user. 
          <p>
            That said, the only way it is visible
            is that the process name shows up in the task list - and since the .exe can be renamed to 
            whatever, and when it is run from source it shows up as "pythonw.exe", it is not <i>immediately</i>
            apparent that there is a keylogger on the system - so it <i>could</i> be used for stealth logging. 
            However, since it also makes periodic writes to disk, and since
            it openly hooks well-known windows APIs (SetWindowHookEx), any keylogger detector worth its salt will be able to sniff it out.
            So basically, it doesn't exactly advertise itself, but doesn't hide itself either.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main goal is to create a "universal backup solution" for everything you type. We have all
            at one time or another accidentally closed that word or notepad file without saving. We have
            all lost form data on the web after it failed to submit properly. Not even mentioning the
            ever-present threat of computer crash. PyKeylogger logs everything you 
            type, so you can recover the text of anything you type in any application. Simple and elegant, don't you think? :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Since PyKeylogger is available as a simple python source file (well, a few simple source files), there are no trust issues
            with using it - you can just look at the source yourself and make sure that it does exactly
            what you need it to, and nothing more. (Especially not sending your info to someone else without your knowledge.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think you can trust me, and/or if you are not interested in getting all those packages
            to run the source file (see instructions below), there is also a binary distribution available for windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although linux may be more in need of such backup, since the autosave feature of many linux programs
            is not as established as that of say, MS Office, unfortunately PyKeylogger is not available for linux yet. If you think
            that you can contribute a linux port of the keylogging function, feel free to jump in.

        <h2><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="icon" />Instructions</h2>

            <p>
                Here is a brief manual for people who like to know what the program is supposed to do without looking at the source. :)
            </p>
            <h4>Installing pykeylogger</h4>
            <p>
                If you want to run PyKeylogger from source, it requires the following dependencies:
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="http://python.org/">python</a> (only 2.3 and up, due to my using the optparse module)
                    <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncassist">pyHook</a>
                    <li> <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html">win32all extensions</a>
                    <li> <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/">py2exe</a> [<font color="red">Optional: only if you want to freeze your own executable out of source.</font> (0.5.4 and up, if you want to freeze from .pyw file, not .py)] 
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                After all those are installed, just double click the keylogger.pyw file,
                and it will run in the background, logging your keys. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, if you want to use the binary distribution, you dont need any of those packages.
                You can just get the binary package for windows. Unzip the archive, put the contents
                anywhere you want (as long as they are all together in the same directory, of course), and run
                keylogger.exe. You can rename the exe to anything you want before running it, if you don't want "keylogger.exe"
                showing up in your task list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Default log location is the directory "C:\Temp\logdir". If you don't like this, or any other defaults, see below
                for command line options. But in general I try to keep the defaults pretty sane, so you can just run without any options if you want to.
            </p>
            <h4>Running pykeylogger</h4>
            <p>
                Since the file's extension is ".pyw", it runs without a console window in the background,
                if you just double-click the file. If you want to see the console (to see error output, e.g.),
                just rename the file with ".py" extension, or run it from command line with 
                <pre class="code">python keylogger.pyw</pre> Running from binary, just run "keylogger_debug.exe" to see the console, 
                instead of the regular "keylogger.exe".
            </p><p></p>

            <h4>Controlling pykeylogger:</h4>
            <p>
                PyKeylogger accepts several commandline options to customize its behavior. They are as follows:
            </p>
            <pre>
            usage: keylogger.pyw [options]
            
            options:
              --version             show program's version number and exit
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -f DIRNAME, --file=DIRNAME
                                    write log data to DIRNAME [default: C:\Temp\logdir]
              -k, --keyboard        log keyboard input [default: True]
              -a, --addlinefeed     add linefeed [\n] character when carriage return [\r]
                                    character is detected (for Notepad compatibility)
                                    [default: False]
              -b, --parsebackspace  translate backspace chacarter into printable string
                                    [default: False]
              -e, --parseescape     translate escape chacarter into printable string
                                    [default: False]
              -x EXITKEY, --exitkey=EXITKEY
                                    specify the key to press to exit keylogger [default:
                                    F12]
              -l FLUSHKEY, --flushkey=FLUSHKEY
                                    specify the key to press to flush write buffer to file
                                    [default: F11]
              -d, --debug           debug mode (print output to console instead of the log
                                    file) [default: False]
              -n NOLOG, --nolog=NOLOG
                                    specify an application by full path name whose input
                                    will not be logged. repeat option for multiple
                                    applications. [default: none]
              -o ONEFILE, --onefile=ONEFILE
                                    log all output to one file ONEFILE, (inside DIRNAME,
                                    as specified with -f option), rather than to multiple
                                    files. [default: none]
              -s SYSTEMLOG, --systemlog=SYSTEMLOG
                                    log all output, plus some debug output, to a SYSTEMLOG
                                    file (inside DIRNAME, as specified with -f option).
                                    [default: none]
              -i INTERVAL, --interval=INTERVAL
                                    specify the time interval between buffer autoflush
                                    events, in seconds. [default: 120.0]
            </pre>
            <p>
                To run in debug mode from source, make sure to use the commandline <pre class="code">python keylogger.pyw -d</pre> 
                rather than just "keylogger.pyw -d". Since the .pyw extension on the source hides the console window,
                unless you do that you will not see any output on the console, because the console is hidden. :)
                The same applies if you want to see the help output from the '-h' option.
            </p>
            <p>
                To run in debug mode from exe, use the keylogger_debug.exe with -d option, NOT the regular keylogger.exe.
            </p>
            <h4>Reading the log files</h4>
            <p>
                The log files are organized in directories, where each directory is named after the application name whose window you 
                were typing into. Inside those directories, there are multiple text files, each file named by date, unique window handle,
                and window title. Thus, if you want to find what you typed in notepad, first go to the notepad directory, then find the 
                log file by date and window title. If you are running with the --onefile option, however, everything just goes into one file. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The log file has two non-printable characters in it: backspace, and escape. Thus, opening the file with
                Notepad or Wordpad, you will see a lot of "junk" characters, if you press a lot of backspace (which I do).
                To read the file properly (where backspace and escape are marked as such), use the excellent editor
                called <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to use windows notepad or wordpad, you may want to clean up the log file, by modifying the filter
                in pykeylogger to substitute a string for those characters, as well as putting in \n\r instead of just \n 
                in order to get the linebreaks in notepad to show up. This can be accomplished by adding appropriate command
                line arguments to the keylogger (see list above).
            </p>
            <p>
                Before checking your log file, press 'F11' on the keyboard, to flush the write buffer to the file, if you want to look
                at the most recent input. If you use Wordpad, you will notice that Wordpad refuses to open a file that is being used, 
                so you will have to make a copy of the logfile and open the copy with wordpad, rather than open the logfile directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of version 0.6.6, pykeylogger automatically flushes the file write buffer periodically (interval set with
                -i option), so that even in the event of a system crash, you are less likely to lose the recent input. 
                [Thanks to anonymous forum poster for this suggestion.]

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li> 
                <font color="green"><b>*** DONE! ***</b>
                Enhance the logging capability so that it splits the keyboard input by window, for ease of finding it later
                (as opposed to the old method of dumping everything into one large log file). 
                </font>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <font color="green"><b>*** DONE! ***</b>
                Add command line option to not log input of certain applications. (For example, Gaim - since it already logs its chats
                if you want to, having PyKeylogger running at the same time would be logging everything twice.) 
                </font>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <font color="green"><b>*** DONE! ***</b>
                Add command line option to log to just one file, instead of the default logging to multiple files. 
                </font>
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a log viewer, where you can search by date, application name, and window title (and of course, text strings). 
                Aiming for something like the Gaim log viewer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improve behavior when logging international keyboard layouts. Right now I am not exactly sure how to properly log
                things like accented and umlaut-ed vowels, etc, so our international users have to put up with less than perfect
                logging.
              <li>
                Another feature I plan for the log viewer is to have an option to parse the backspaces and arrow keys to recreate 
                the final output, rather than have a bunch of [Backspace] and [LeftArrow] text in the log. Of course, if you want that
                to be particularly useful, you have to try to refrain from using the mouse to reposition your cursor :). I wonder if
                this is really going to be helpful...
              </li>
              <li>
                As per a suggestion I received through feature requests on sf, I want to log all kb/mouse (though maybe to start with, just kb)
                events, and have them be re-playable as if they are being typed. Goal is to support gui testing.

            In particular, it would be nice if you could port the code to linux. Currently, PyKeylogger uses the pyHook
            module, which is windows only, since it is a wrapper of the set of Windows APIs. I have no access to a linux box
            at the moment, nor do I have much of a clue on how to hook keyboard input at the system level in linux.
